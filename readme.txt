Speed up your site’s load time with Crush.pics easy to use automated image compression. Smaller image sizes = quicker page load times.

== Description ==

Image compression is the process of minimizing the size of an image file without changing the physical dimensions of the image or degrading its visual quality to an unacceptable level. This process is often referred to as "image optimization".

Compressed images downloaded faster when viewed on a web page. The ability to serve your images quickly is essential to keeping customers on your site and engaged.

*There’s a lot of image compressors out there, why choose Crush.pics?*
