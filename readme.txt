== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need to be an expert to use the plugin? =
    Absolutely not! We designed Crush.pics to be simple for everyone to use.

= How does Crush.pics compare to other image optimization plugins =
  There are many great options to choose from. Using any of them is a huge step in the right directly which we wholeheartedly support. One major difference; While most plugins use the same compression level for every file, our **Balanced Compression** algorithm calculates the optimal compression level for each file individually. Ultimately resulting in the biggest size savings possible while still keeping beautiful, sharp, high quality images.

= Can I use the same API Key on multiple web sites? =
    Yes!

= Can I optimize my current images and new images? =
    Yes!

= What image formats does Crush.pics support? =
    Currently - JPEG, PNG and GIF.

= If I delete the Crush.pics plugin, will my images stay optimised? =
    Absolutely! Once optimized the images will remain optimized unless you explicitly choose to restore them. But why would you do that? :-)

= Can I do a one-time compression of my images? =
    Of course! Simply select the appropriate plan for your needs, and once your compression is complete simply downgrade to the Free Plan within 30 days. This process will charge your chosen plan's fee one-time.

= What if my plan's quota isn't enough? =
    Crush.pics will notify you if your current plan is unable to compress all your images. To complete the compression of your images you'll need to upgrade to a higher plan, then any remaining images will continue compressing automatically.
